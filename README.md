# projects
This a project home to showcase projects. It is divided into 3 parts.First: WGU school work, including papers, programming projects and data analytics projects - most of it is trivial work. Second:  online learning artifacts from projects completed on Coursera, Datacamp or. DeepLearning.ai . Third: projects I did because the subject interested me or doing the project was a good vehicle for learning new stuff.
